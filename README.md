# CryptoClustering
This challenge involves using Python and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The goal is to determine whether cryptocurrencies exhibit patterns or clustering based on 24-hour and 7-day price changes. The purpose is to explore patterns in cryptocurrency behavior, allowing for better market analysis and predictions. By clustering similar cryptocurrencies, analysts and investors can make more informed financial decisions.

### Key Steps:
1.	Data Preparation – Load and normalize market data to ensure consistency.
2.	Finding Optimal Clusters (k-value) – Use the Elbow Method to identify the best number of clusters for grouping cryptocurrencies.
3.	K-Means Clustering – Implement K-Means on the processed data to create cryptocurrency groups based on price fluctuations.
4.	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Reduce data complexity and check if clustering results improve using PCA-transformed data.
5.	Visualization – Generate scatter plots to visually interpret the clustering results and compare insights from both methods.
